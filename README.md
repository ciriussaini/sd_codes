**Unix File:**

    Don't get confused by UNIX. Its generic for any OS.
    Directory and files and common properties and methods. So defining a base class for both would be useful.
    Directory contains files and sub directories. So directory is an Entry and has List of entries.
    Search files using BFS
    Create IFileSearchFilter(a better name i feel) to represent a contract for search.

one improvement here is to tell interviewer how interface will help in dependency injection and hence loose coupling.
