 **Design Pattern**
* Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving the common object-oriented design problems.
* That means, a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. 

**Problem Given:**
**Q1** Suppose you want to create a class for which only a single instance (or object) should be created and that single object can be used by all other classes. 
**Solution:**
Singleton design pattern is the best solution of above specific problem. 
So, every design pattern has some specification or set of rules for solving the problems. 
What are those specifications, you will see later in the types of design patterns. 
**
By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintainable.**
